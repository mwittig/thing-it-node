**[thing-it-node]** is **a scalable Operating System for Things** and allows you to

* connect multiple Devices (e.g. Heart Rate Monitors, Sensor Tags, Drones) as well as low-level Actors and Sensors managed via Microcontrollers like an Arduino
  to your node computer (e.g. a regular server, a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Installation-Raspberry-Pi-Zero) or a BeagleBone Black)
* invoke **REST Services** on all Devices and Actors,
* receive **WebSocket Notifications** on all Device and Sensor state changes and events,
* define **Higher-level REST Services** to control multiple Actors,
* define **Complex Event Processing** to react to Sensor events and state changes,
* define **Storyboards** for the timeline-based invocation of Node, Device and Actor Services (e.g. for robotics),
* define **Job Schedules** for a calendar-based, recurring execution of Services including start of Storyboards,
* define **Complex Data Variables** to persistently store Event Data for later evaluation or for configurations
* manage **Users an their Entitlements** to access the above elements and
* use a **Mobile App** to monitor and control arbitrary Devices.

All of the above is controlled by a [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) server which is bootstrapped from a **simple JSON configuration**, which allows you to
e.g. configure a **complex Device control in minutes**.

# Getting Started

## The Scenario

Let's set up a simple Smart Home scenario leveraging the easy-to-configure Z-Wave standard with

* an Ambient Light Sensor,
* a Light Buld and
* a Switch fo arbitrary powered Devices (e.g. your electrical rocking chair)

In our scenario we will

* discover all the above Z-Wave Devices automatically with [thing-it-node] after they are paired,
* expose toggle on Light Bulb and Switch with a simple service call - which you could invoke from the [thing-it] Mobile App or from your own Web App via REST,
* detect if the ambient light goes below a certain threshold for a longer timeframe - not if your cat strays past -, switch the light bulb on
and whatever you have connected to the switch.

## Prerequisites

As Z-Wave communication is a standard component of [thing-it-node], you need to install *Open Z-Wave* on your Device Gateway Computer.

### Linux and OSX

For all Raspberry Pi/C.H.I.P/BeagleBone - and yes, OSX - users:

You will need to ensure the OpenZWave library and headers are installed first. You can do this one of two ways:

* Downloading the source tarball from the [OpenZWave repository](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/releases) and then compiling it and installing on your system via **make** and **sudo make install**.
* You could also install OpenZWave via a precompiled package that's suitable for your Linux distribution and architecture. Notice: Be sure to install BOTH the binary (libopenzwave-x.y) AND the development package (libopenzwave-dev).

### Windows

Since there is no standard installation location for Open Z-Wave on Windows, it will be automatically downloaded, compiled, and installed when you install
**openzwave-shared** via **npm** (which we will be installing with [thing-it-node]).

## Installing, Configuring and Running [thing-it-node]

To install, configure and run  **[thing-it-node]**, first install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
on your computer (e.g. your PC or your [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Installation-Raspberry-Pi-Zero)). 

Then install **[thing-it-node]** via

```
npm -g install thing-it-node 
```

which will install **[thing-it-node]** in your global **/node_modules** directory and makes it available 
via the command line program **tin**.

Note, that depending on the access right settings on your file system you may need to invoke

```
sudo npm -g install thing-it-node 
```

instead.

Now create an arbitrary Installation Directory **_installDir_** and make it your current working directory, e.g.

```
mkdir ~/thing-it-test
cd ~/thing-it-test
```

Then invoke

```
tin example -f simple-z-wave
```

which will create a directory **_installDir_/configurations** and copy the sample **[thing-it-node]** Node Configuration
**simple-z-wave.js** into it from which **[thing-it-node]** can be booted.

If you are interested, have a look at this [Node Configuration File](./thing-it-node/examples/simple-lighting/configuration.json) - the content should be self-explanatory.

Probably the most interesting part is the Event Processing

```javascript
{
            id: "eventProcessor3",
            label: "Event Processor 3",
            observables: ["zWaveNetwork.multiSensor"],
            trigger: {
                type: "timeInterval",
                content: {
                    interval: 10000,
                    cumulation: "maximum",
                    stateVariable: "luminousIntensity",
                    compareOperator: "<",
                    compareValue: 600
                }
            },
            action: {
                type: "nodeService", "content": {"service": "toggleAll"}
            }
        }
```

Start the **[thing-it-node]** first via

```
tin run --simulate
```

You will see something like

    Running [thing-it-node] from Default Options.
      
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Protocol                     : http
     Port                         : 3001
     Node Configurations Directory: /Users/marcgille/git/thing-it-node/configurations
     Simulated                    : true
     Log Level                    : debug
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    
    12/1/2015 6:32:01 AM INFO NodeManager ===> Scanning directory [/Users/marcgille/git/thing-it-node/lib/../node_modules] for Device Plugins: 		    Actor [LED1] started.
    ...

    12/1/2015 6:32:01 AM INFO Node[The Node] Node [The Node] started.

which means that your **[thing-it-node]** Server found its configuration and has been started properly. It is not doing anything because the option **simulated** is set to **true** in the default options. 
You could already use the **[thing-it-node]** Mobile Client against the simulated configuration (which you definitely would do on a new configuration), but for now we want the real thing.

Stop the **[thing-it-node]** Server with **CTRL-C** to prepare **[thing-it-node]** to talk to a real Device.

## Setting up Devices

You need to purchase a Z-Wave controller,
e.g. an [Aeotec Z-Stick](http://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick).

Also purchase a few Z-Wave devices, e.g.

* an [Aeotec By Aeon Labs Gen5 Z-wave Plus 6-in-1 Multisensor 6 ZW100-A](http://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Aeon-Labs-Z-wave-Multisensor/dp/B00WMEVRRW/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1455407667&sr=1-3-catcorr&keywords=z-wave+light+sensor),
* a [GoControl Z-Wave Dimmable LED Light Bulb] (http://www.amazon.com/GoControl-Z-Wave-Dimmable-Light-LB60Z-1/dp/B00PJH16UC),
* a [Aeon Labs DSC06106-ZWUS - Z-Wave Smart Energy Switch](http://www.amazon.com/Aeon-Labs-DSC06106-ZWUS-Z-Wave-Energy/dp/B007UZH7B8)

Pair these devices with you Z-Wave Controller in the above order by following the documentation which comes with the Controller. It usually involves
just clicking the pairing button close to the Device.

Restart the **thing-it-node** server with

```
tin run
```

The output should now look like 

    Running [thing-it-node] from Default Options.

     Node Configurations Directory: /Users/marcgille/git/thing-it-node/configurations
     Simulated                    : false
     Log Level                    : debug

## Running the Mobile Web App

Connect your browser to 

`http://localhost:3001/mobile/index.html`

<p align="center"><a href="./documentation/images/mobile-client.png"><img src="./documentation/images/mobile-client.png" width="70%" height="70%"></a></p>

Instead of the browser-based UI - mobile or on your computer - you can use the **[thing-it] Mobile App** from [Apple Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thing-it-mobile/id1055394072?ls=1&mt=8) or
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thingit.console&hl=en).

## Summary

Let us recap what we did:

With

* a simple configuration file,
* the corresponding wiring of the Arduino 

but **no programming** we were able to access a not-too-trivial Actor/Sensor setup. Imagine you had put together complex electronics, 
wanted a control panel and put most of the Device's logic in the [thing-it-node] configuration.

## Using thing-it.com

If you still find the creation of the configuration file too technical (we agree ...) - you may consider to use the free services of [www.thing-it.com](http://www.thing-it.com) to create and simulate your setup and then just download the configuration file.

The Simple Lighting solution presented here is available as a Mesh under

[http://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/index.html?offer=54d417205a538cc81b0d31c9#/meshOfferPanel](http://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/index.html?offer=54d417205a538cc81b0d31c9#/meshOfferPanel)

You can find other Meshes in the [thing-it] [Mesh Market](http://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/index.html#/searchPanel) for free simulation and download.

To create your own solutions on [www.thing-it.com](http://www.thing-it.com) you would define **Nodes** and **Devices**

<img src="./documentation/images/thing-it-node-configuration.png" style="">

put **Actors**, **Sensors**, **Services** and **Event Processors** together,

<img src="./documentation/images/thing-it-switchboard.png" style="">

edit the logic of **Event Processors**

<img src="./documentation/images/thing-it-event-processor.png" style="">

and **Services** and then simulate and test the configuration before you download it to your **[thing-it-node]** deployment.

Consider the [[thing-it] Documentation](http://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/index.html#/documentationPanel) to configure the scenario described above.
