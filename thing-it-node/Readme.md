**[thing-it-node]** allows you to 

* connect multiple devices like an Arduino Uno or a Bluetooth-enabled Wristband to your node computer (e.g. a regular server, a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black) to centralize Internet access to a scalable set of Sensors and Actors connected to these devices, 
* invoke **REST Services** on all Actors, 
* receive **WebSocket Notifications** on all Sensor data changes and events,
* define **Higher-level REST Services** to control multiple Actors,
* define **Complex Event Processing** to react on Sensor events and data changes and
* use a **Mobile Client** to control your devices.
