[thing-it-node] Device Plugin for OSRAM Lightify Gateway to control ZigBee Devices like OSRAM Lightify Light Bulbs and others.

This allows you to 

* control OSRAM Lightify Bulbs and Lamps over the Internet,
* define complex scenes, storyboards and timer controlled execution 

by means of [thing-it-node](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node) and [thing-it.com](http://www.thing-it.com).

## Installation

### Installation of NodeJS and [thing-it-node]

First, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer (e.g. your PC or your Raspberry Pi).

Then install **[thing-it-node]** via

```
npm install -g thing-it-node
```
 
### Initialization and Start of [thing-it-node] 

The **[thing-it-device-osram-lightify]** Plugin is installed with **[thing-it-node]**, hence there is no need to install it separately.

The Plugin supports Autodiscovery, hence you only have to create a directory in which you intend to run the configuration, e.g.
 
```
mkdir ~/lightify-test
cd ~/lightify-test
```

and invoke

```
tin init
```

and then start **[thing-it-node]** via

```
tin run
```

Install the **thing-it Mobile App** from the Apple Appstore or Google Play and set it up to connect to **[thing-it-node]** 
locally as described [here](https://thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/connectionModes) or just connect your browser under 
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
 
### OSRAM Lightify Setup

Set up your OSRAM Lightify Gateway as described in the OSRAM Lightify documentation and/or instructions in the Mobile App to the same network as the [thing-it-node] Node Box you have configured above 
and install all lighting and other devices also following the OSRAM Lightify documentation and/or  instructions in the Mobile App.

On the **[thing-it] Mobile App** or in the browser, confirm the registration of the OSRAM Lightify Gateway.

**[thing-it-node]** will automatically add all light bulbs and other OSRAM Lightify devices to your **[thing-it-node]** Configuration and 
you will be able control these from the **[thing-it] Mobile App** immediately.

## Mobile UI
