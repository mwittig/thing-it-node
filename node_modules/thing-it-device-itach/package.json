E.g. for a [Configuration\nwith a Samsung TV and iRobot Roomba Cleaning Robot](./examples/samsungAndRoombaConfiguration.js):\n\n<img src=\"./documentation/images/samsung-and-roomba-ui.jpg\">\n\n## Adding your own Remotes\n\nYou can create your own Devices with their own User Interface to send IR commands via the **ITach Bridge**. It just requires \n\n* adding the desired IR commands to a simple JavaScript file (e.g. [iRobotRoombaRemote.js](./iRobotRoombaRemote.js)) and\n* writing a bit of HTML code (e.g. [web/iRobotRoombaRemote.html](./web/iRobotRoombaRemote.html)) to invoke the Device Services to submit the IR commands.\n\nTo obtain the IR commands for your remote control, we have created an **IrSniffer** Device. This (auxiliary) **IrSniffer** Device is autodiscoverable.\n\nTo get access to the **IrSniffer** Device connect the **ITach Brige** to your network and initialize **[thing-it-node]** in an arbitrary \ndirectory with\n\n```\ntin init\n```\n\nand start with\n\n```\ntin run\n```\n\nThe **IrSniffer** Device it will advertise itself in your Mobile App or Browser UI connected to the **[thing-it-node]** instance started above.\n\nAfter you confirmed the Device Registration for the **IrSniffer** you should see\n\n<img src=\"./documentation/images/sniffer-ui.jpg\">\n\nClick all relevant buttons on your remote and record the corresponding codes. With these create a file **myRemote.js** like\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = require(\"./lib/itach\").createExports({\n    family: \"myRemote\", plugin: \"myRemote\",\n    label: \"My Remote\"\n}, {\n    \"button1\": code1,\n    \"button2\": code2,\n    ...\n});\n```\n\nHereby, make sure that you strip the **\"sendir,_module_:_connector_,\"** part from the command.\n\nThen create an **myRemote.html** file under /web, e.g.\n\n```html\n<div style=\"display: table-row;\">\n        <div style=\"display: table-cell; padding: 0.5em;\">\n            <div class=\"circleButton\" ng-click=\"panel.callDeviceService(component, 'button1')\">1\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div style=\"display: table-cell; padding: 0.5em;\">\n            <div class=\"circleButton\" ng-click=\"panel.callDeviceService(component, 'button2')\">2\n            </div>\n        </div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nYou can surely be more creative with your UI and finally get the remote control layout you always wanted.\n\n## Where to go from here ...\n\nAfter completing the above, you may be interested in\n\n* Configuring additional [Devices](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/deviceConfiguration), \n[Groups](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/groupConfiguration), \n[Services](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/serviceConfiguration), \n[Event Processing](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/eventConfiguration), \n[Storyboards](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/storyboardConfiguration) and \n[Jobs](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/jobConfiguration) via your **[thing-it] Mobile App**.\n* Use [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) to safely connect your Node Box from everywhere, manage complex configurations, store and analyze historical data \nand offer your configurations to others on the **[thing-it] Mesh Market**.\n* Explore other Device Plugins like [Philips Hue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-philips-hue), [Plugwise Smart Switches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-plugwise) and many more. For a full set of \nDevice Plugins search for **thing-it-device** on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Or [write your own Plugins](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Plugin-Development-Concepts).\n\n\n\n\n",
